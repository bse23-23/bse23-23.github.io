                  Throughout our water theft and leak detection project with
                  Group 23-23, I had the honor of conducting interviews with
                  some of the most dedicated and experienced professionals at
                  NWSC. As we walked into the NWSC offices, I felt a rush of
                  excitement and anticipation about what I was going to learn
                  from these experts and the insights they would offer about the
                  challenges facing the organization and its water distribution
                  network. Among the many interviews, one stood out as a truly
                  memorable experience. It was with a technician who had been
                  working with NWSC for over a decade, and his passion for his
                  work was evident from the warm smile he greeted us with. As we
                  delved into the discussion on water theft and leakages, he
                  shared some moving stories about the negative impact of water
                  scarcity on the local community. His urgency and conviction
                  about addressing these challenges left me inspired and
                  energized. I was impressed by the technician's technical
                  expertise and his deep understanding of water distribution. He
                  had been involved in various projects aimed at improving the
                  network's efficiency and effectiveness. His passion for
                  finding solutions to the organization's challenges was
                  infectious, and I left the interview feeling motivated to
                  tackle even the most complex problems. Despite the incredible
                  learning opportunities, the project was not without its
                  challenges. For me, analyzing the data we collected was
                  daunting since I had to learn R programming from scratch. I
                  spent long hours researching and practicing to master the
                  language. Additionally, working on an embedded project was a
                  new experience, and I had to learn on the job. Thankfully, my
                  team members and supervisors provided excellent guidance and
                  support, enabling me to make meaningful contributions to the
                  project. We also encountered challenges during the literature
                  review process, as it was difficult to find similar literature
                  to inform our research. However, we persisted and identified
                  relevant literature to guide our analysis and inform our
                  findings. Overall, the project was an excellent opportunity to
                  learn, grow, and contribute to a crucial issue affecting our
                  community. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and
                  I am proud of the work we accomplished as a team. I am eager
                  to see the impact the project will have on water management
                  practices and the community, and I am grateful for the
                  knowledge and skills I gained from this project. Stay tuned
                  for more updates as we move into the development of our
                  solution.
